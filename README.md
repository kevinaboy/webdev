# Web Developer Portfolio

This project is a recreation of my original [portfolio](https://github.com/kevinaboy/portfolio) but this time I'm using [React](https://reactjs.org/). The website was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and contains Bootstrap elements.

The website features several sections:
- About Me
- Work Experience
- Education
- Skills
- Portfolio
- Contact (let's connect!)
